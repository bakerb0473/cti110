# The pip module comes with the python installation and
# acts as a module downloader/manager
# You can download other modules from the internet with pip

# The pip module is not used in the python interpreter
# it's run thru the command line

# To use:
# open your command line interpreter (Windows - Command Prompt)
# type the following code "py3 -m pip install module"
# but this code didn't work for me



# This is an alternate code:


def main():


    pip install module



# Program start
main()
